    The index estimates the years of formal education a person needs to understand the text on the first reading.
    A fog index of 12 requires the reading level of a U.S. high school senior (around 18 years old).
    Texts for a wide audience generally need a fog index less than 12.
    Texts requiring near-universal understanding generally need an index less than 8.
